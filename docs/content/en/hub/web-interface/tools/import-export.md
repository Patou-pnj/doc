Import entries directly into your Hub or export data in JSON format or using a PowerShell script ({{ en.DHUBB }} only). For more flexibility, try our [{{ en.DHUBI }}](/hub/web-interface/tools/hub-importer/).

## Import
Import JSON and CSV entry files in {{ en.DHUB }}.

1. In ***Help & Tools***, click on ***Import***.
![Help & Tools – Import](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2018_2024_1.png)
1. Select the format of the imported file (JSON or CSV) between the following options: 
    * RDM (.json)
    * Bitwarden (.json)
    * Bitwarden (.csv)
    * Google Chrome (.csv)
    * KeePass (.csv)
    * LastPass (.csv)
    * 1Password (.csv)

   ![Import format](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2019_2024_1.png)
1. Upload the file (one at a time) to your Hub by either dragging and dropping it directly or by selecting a file through your device's file browser.
1. Select a ***Destination {{ en.VLT }}*** ({{ en.DHUBB }} only) and a ***Destination folder***, or create a new folder. This is where the entries are imported.
![Destination {{ en.VLT }} and folder](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2020_2024_1.png)
1. Click ***Import***.
1. A summary of all the entries to import will appear. Click ***Complete import***.
![Complete import](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2021_2024_1.png)  
The import process takes some time depending on the size of your file. Once the file is imported, you will be brought to where the entries are located.

## Export
Export data in one of two ways:
* [in JSON or CSV using a PowerShell script](#powershell-script-export-type) (only for {{ en.DHUBB }}).
* [in the JSON format](#json-export-type).

### PowerShell Script export type
This method is only available with {{ en.DHUBB }} and requires PowerShell 7 or later.

1. In ***Help & Tools***, click on ***Export***.
![Help & Tools – Export](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2022_2024_1.png)
1. Select the ***PowerShell Script*** export type.
![PowerShell Script export type](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2025_2024_1.png)
1. [Create an application identity](/hub/web-interface/administration/management/application-users/) and assign it the ***Manager*** role to the {{ en.VLT }} wanted. Once done, you have the choice to [automatically](#automatically-fill-in-the-information) or [manually](#manually-fill-in-the-information) fill in your information in the PowerShell script.

#### Automatically fill in the information
1. Select the ***Automatic*** option.
![Automatic option](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2023_2024_1.png)
1. Enter your application identity's ***Application secret*** and ***Application key*** in the corresponding fields.
1. Enter the ***Destination folder path***. This is where your data will be exported.
1. Choose to export in JSON or CSV.
1. Click ***Download***.
1. Run the downloaded script using PowerShell 7.

Your data has been exported to the destination folder.

#### Manually fill in the information
1. Select the ***Manual*** option.
![Manual option](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2024_2024_1.png)
1. Choose to export in JSON or CSV.
1. Copy and paste the script in a PowerShell file (.ps1).
1. In your copied script, change the variables with the appropriate information. See the table below.
   | Variable                | Description                                                                                                     |
   |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `$url`                  | Enter your {{ en.DHUBB }} URL. This variable is automatically filled in, but it is still possible to change it. |
   | `$appSecret`            | Enter the application user's ***Application Secret***.                                                          |
   | `$appKey`               | Enter the application user's ***Application key***.                                                             |
   | `$pathToExportedFolder` | Enter the ***Destination folder path*** This is where your data will be exported.                               |

   ![Variables in PowerShell](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/docs_en_kb_KB2082.png)
1. Run the script using PowerShell 7.

Your data has been exported to the destination folder.

### JSON export type
1. In ***Help & Tools***, click on ***Export***.
![Help & Tools – Export](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2022_2024_1.png)
1. Select the ***JSON*** export type.
![JSON export type](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2026_2024_1.png)
1. Select a {{ en.VLT }} to export ({{ en.DHUBB }} only) and customize the two related options.
    * ***Obfuscate sensitive values***: This option is enabled by default. Your sensitive information will be harder to decypher. For security purposes, it is recommended to leave it checked.
    * ***Include attachments and documents***: If enabled, this option allows you to also export the attachments and documents in your folders and entries.
1. Select the folders and entries to export.  
![Select the folder(s) to export](https://cdnweb.devolutions.net/docs/HUBB2027_2024_1.png)
1. Click ***Download*** to export your selection in JSON format. The JSON file can be imported in {{ en.RDM }}, {{ en.DHUBB }}, or {{ en.DHUBP }}.


If you get an error while you export using the PowerShell script provided by HUB Business:

$entries = Get-HubEntriesForExport -VaultId $vault.id
     |               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     | The api call with Hub failed. Forbidden - Access denied

This could be related to the permissions on the System Vault.
To avoid this issue, we suggest setting permission for your application identity directly by the System Permissions instead of per vaults.
This global change will apply for proper permission on the system vault.
